Install instructions:

Download and unzip the uno.zip with the similar process of unzipping release code
of assignment 2. All other functionalities, are also similar to those in assignment
2, and there is attribution listed in each mli file that this project is built 
based on release code and assignment code of A2. 

To test the game interface, 
locate in the right folder and type "make play". To start the game, type 
"uno.json", as the game instruction says. You may choose a player number 
between 2 and 10. To test the game quickly, choose 10 so the game end soon
either because a non user player wins or the cards runs out; to try more 
commands or to win the game, use 2 so you can play longer. 

There are several valid commands to try:

take - randomly take a new card until there is no card left

use + color + number - e.g. use red zero
                      play a card if you have it and it has either the same number 
                      or the same color as the current card

use + color + "draw two" - e.g. use green draw two 
                          if the current card is a green one or a draw two of 
                          other colors then you can use 
                          green draw two if you have it. the next player will 
                          get two cards. if there are no enough cards left, 
                          you are recommended by error message to quit and 
                          restart the game. 

use + color + "skip" - e.g. use blue skip 
                      the color/number matching mechanism applies. if you use 
                      a skip card, the next player won't be able to take actions
                      in this round. 

use + color + "reverse" - e.g. use yellow reverse
                        the color/number matching mechanism applies. if you use 
                        a reverse card, the order of the players taking actions 
                        will get reversed. For example, if player 1 uses a 
                        reverse card and the next was player 2's turn, it now 
                        turns to player 10, 9, 8, ect. 

use + "wild color" - i.e. use wild color 
                    a wild color card can be used regardless of the current 
                    card. if used, you are asked to choose a color (red, 
                    green, yellow, blue. anything else gives you error message.)
                    The current card will change to that color, remaining the 
                    number. e.g. if you choose green, the current card red one 
                    will change to green one. 

use + "wild draw four" -i.e. use wild draw four 
                       a wild color card can be used anytime as long as there 
                       are enough cards left. if not, it's impossible for you 
                       to win anyway so you are recommended by error message to
                       quit and restart. if a wild draw four card is used, you
                       are asked to choose a color to change to, same as wild 
                       color. also the next player gets four more cards. 

uno - you are reminded each time at your turn that if you have only one card 
      left, you need to call uno. this only applies to you but not the non user
      players. if you forgets to do so, you fails to take action in this round 
      and you get one more card. after call uno when you have one card left, 
      if you can use that card, use it and you win; if you can't use it, take
      a new card so the game continues. 

quit - quit the game

Every time a new round of game begins, a random initial current card is generated 
and seven randoms cards are given to you and each of other players. The aim 
is to use out all cards. 

You can see your cards left, the number of cards left for each player 
and the number of cards left after each action. You can't see what exactly 
cards other players are holding, unless you uncomment the line 92-103 of the 
main.ml, those are cheating lines if you want to check whether the game 
runs properly. 

p.s. there are sometimes situations when a wild card is used after a wild card, 
the card number is set to zero after you requires a color change (since it 
is illegal to have a card like red color / red draw four. )

p.p.s a quick way to check the program is to let user_command = "take" in line
218 of main.ml so the games goes on automatically.
